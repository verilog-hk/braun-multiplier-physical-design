# braun-multiplier-physical-design
Complete RTL to GDSII implementation of a Braun Array Multiplier using Synopsys tools and SAED 32nm
üßÆ Braun Array Multiplier ‚Äì RTL to GDSII

This project implements a 4√ó4 Braun Array Multiplier using Verilog and completes a full ASIC physical design flow using Synopsys tools and the SAED 32nm standard cell library. It was developed under the Lifelong Learning program at SRMIST.

## üéØ Project Objective

To design a pipelined, area-efficient digital multiplier using a modular structure and implement it through the entire RTL to GDSII design process. This includes simulation, synthesis, layout generation, and GDSII export.
